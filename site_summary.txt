Site summary

This is a single-page recruitment and marketing site for GODMC, built to quickly communicate who the group is, what
it stands for, and how to join.

What visitors see

Hero header with your branding and a strong tagline (“Fly smart. Fight together.”) that sets the tone immediately.

What we believe in section that explains culture and expectations (newbro-friendly, disciplined fights, no drama).

Recruitment section with clear requirements and a simple “how to join” flow (Discord-first).

Life in GODMC image gallery to showcase the vibe and activities visually.

Fleet / combat highlight banner area for additional atmosphere and brand identity.

zKillboard live killfeed that displays recent alliance kills and auto-updates every 2 minutes, 
showing social proof and activity (with hover “pop” images like ship icons/portraits depending on the data available).

Why it works

Fast to understand: culture + expectations + join steps are above the gallery, so new visitors 
get the message before scrolling deep.

Credibility: the live zKillboard feed demonstrates active fleets and ongoing PvP.

Clean call-to-action: the join path is obvious and frictionless (Discord + a short intro message).

What the client is getting

A lightweight, low-maintenance site that can be hosted free (GitHub Pages)

Easy updates (swap images/links/text in one HTML file)

Built-in activity signal (auto-refreshing killfeed)
